# javascript-challenge

This project involved adding a table row into the body of the html code for each item listed in the data file, then inputting the data from said file into the row that was created.  An event handler was created to take the date that was input into the search box and create a filtered data set based on that date.  The table data was clearead, then a new table was created by inserting a row for each item in the filtered data set, then taking the data values and adding them to the newly created table.
